# dlk_maps_fivem

100% credit goes to:

  DieLikeKane for the amazing maps (https://dielikekane.com/gtav-fivem-map-mods/)
  
  DementedDude (https://forum.cfx.re/u/dementeddude) and Virus_City () for creating the server sided map scripts

i just edited the files to include a higher resolution texture so the in-game radar doesn't look super blurry when using DLK's maps.

i've included the hd atlas map and the hd satellite map from DLK's maps, you only need to use one. check his site if you need to see the difference between them.
