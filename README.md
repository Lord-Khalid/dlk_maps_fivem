  DieLikeKane for the amazing maps (https://dielikekane.com/gtav-fivem-map-mods/)
  
  DementedDude (https://forum.cfx.re/u/dementeddude) and Virus_City (https://forum.cfx.re/u/virus_city/) for creating the server sided map scripts

all i had to do was add the missing files to make the map show up properly on the radar and replaced the radar map texture with a higher resolution texture to fix the blur issues.

i've included the hd atlas map (map-atlas), the hd satellite map (map-satellite) and a hybrid version (map-hybrid; satellite map on pause, atlas map on radar) from DLK's maps, you only need to use one. place the folder you choose in your 'server-data\resources' folder and add 'ensure yourmapchoice' to your 'server.cfg' (replace 'yourmapchoice' with the name of the folder you chose). check his site if you want to see the difference between the map choices:
