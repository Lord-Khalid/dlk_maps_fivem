100% credit goes to:

  DieLikeKane for the amazing maps (https://dielikekane.com/gtav-fivem-map-mods/)
  
  DementedDude (https://forum.cfx.re/u/dementeddude) and Virus_City () for creating the server sided map scripts

i just edited DLK's files to include a higher resolution radar texture so the in-game radar doesn't look super blurry when using these great maps.

i've included the hd atlas map and the hd satellite map from DLK's maps, you only need to use one. check his site if you need to see the difference between them.
